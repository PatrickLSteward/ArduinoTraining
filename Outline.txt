-Motor
-Potentiometer

Requirements (High Level):
- The system shall monitor temperature within the VALID_RANGE. 
- The system shall display the current temperature on the LCD_DISPLAY.
- The system shall produce a WARNING if the temperature exceedes HIGH_TEMPERATURE_THRESHOLD.

Requirements (Low Level):
- VALID_RANGE shall be in the range of 32F to 120F, inclusive.
- The HIGH_TEMPERATURE_THRESHOLD shall be whithin 100F and 120F, inclusive.
- The WARNING shall include a LCD_DISPLAY, BUZZER, and LED.
- The LCD_DISPLAY shall display the current temperature in Celsuis or Fahrenheit.
- BUTTON shall toggle the temperature between Celsuis and Fahrenheight on LCD_DISPLAY.
- The BUZZER shall alert the user if the HIGH_TEMPERATURE_THRESHOLD has been exceeded.
- The LCD_DISPLAY shall display an OVER_HEATING_MESSAGE should the HIGH_TEMPERATURE_THRESHOLD be exceeded.
- The LED shall light up if the HIGH_TEMPERATURE_THRESHOLD is exceeded.

Tasks:
- set up the circuit

Function Requirements:
- int getTemp(potentiometer input); // returns temperature in Fahrenheit
- int getStatus(); // reurns a corresponding alert flag for a specified threshold
    - 0 = normal
    - 1 = high (alert)
- string DispMessage(float potentionmeter_val, int mode, int alert)
   mode: 0: F, 1:C
   alert 0: ok, 1: above threshold
